## Dataset Description

### House Price Prediction
**Description**: Predicts house prices based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other property details.

### Car Price Prediction
**Description**: Predicts car prices based on attributes like brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and engine specifications.

### Gold Price Prediction
**Description**: Predicts the price of gold based on historical data, including currency exchange rates, inflation rates, and global financial indicators.

### Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
**Description**: Predicts insurance premiums based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, and medical conditions.

### Big Mart Sales Prediction
**Description**: Predicts sales for various items in different stores based on factors such as store type, item visibility, and marketing data.

### Calories Burnt Prediction
**Description**: Predicts the number of calories burnt based on physical activities, age, weight, and duration of exercise.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Development Process

Each classification project was developed through the following steps:

1. **Importing the Dependencies**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Handling missing values
    - Handling outliers
    - Label encoding/One-hot encoding
    - Standardizing the data
4. **Model Selection**
    - Selected the most common 5 regression models
    - Trained each model and checked cross-validation scores
    - Chose the top 3 models based on cross-validation scores
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**
    - Selected best features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
    - Performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV
    - Built the final model with the best hyperparameters and features
    - Evaluated the model using mean squared error, R-squared score, and other relevant metrics
